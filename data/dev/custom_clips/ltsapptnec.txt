Hi name,

We tried to contact you today but unfortunately were unsuccessfully. nbn have deemed an appointment to your premises necessary to investigate your offline fault and one of their delivery partners should be in contact with you over the next 10 business days. If you haven't heard from anyone after this time period please contact us by replying to this email or contacting us on 1300 759 637. 

Regards, 
Rhys.
