    it’s just a heavily utilised cell that’s causing the slow downs, it’s still recommended
    to log a fault.\r\nThe reason for that is that we use the number of tickets raised
    against a cell as one of the many inputs to deciding the priority of capacity
    upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe EU has been getting slow speeds. The slow speeds do no correlate
    to any CVC contention or fault condition.\r\n\r\nCan you please check with the
    wireless team to see if there is any cellular contention affecting this service
    and if so is there any upgrades planned that would benefit this user.\r\n\r\nOur
    nbn CDM has indicated we can place such requests to check nbn cellular contention
    without a complete troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nRecent speed tests results for this EU
